# Sorting-Techniques
You are required to implement:  - three O ( ଶ ) sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Bubble  Sort, and Insertion Sort.  - three O (n log n) sorting algorithms: Merge Sort, Heap Sort  and Quick sort algorithm in the average case.  Now you have implemented six sorting techniques: three of  them are O ( ଶ ) and the other three are O (n log n).  You are required to compare the running time performance  of your algorithms against each other.  To test your implementation and analyze the running time  performance, generate a dataset of random numbers, and plot the  relationship between the execution time of the sorting algorithm  versus the input size.
